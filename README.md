## Project Overview

Crystal Beauty Clear is a modern e-commerce platform built with **React** and powered by a backend API (assumed to be hosted at `VITE_BACKEND_URL`). It caters to beauty lovers seeking authentic skincare, makeup, haircare, fragrances, men‚Äôs grooming products, and gift sets. The application features a responsive frontend, a comprehensive admin dashboard, and innovative features like skeleton loading and smart inventory management. Developed for a course assignment, the project aims to demonstrate technical expertise, user-centric design, and scalability, making it a strong candidate for the top three projects in the evaluation.

## Features

### User Features üõçÔ∏è

- **Seamless Navigation**: A responsive `NavBar` with a mobile-friendly hamburger menu and a user profile popup for quick access to account details, orders, and logout functionality.
- **Engaging Hero Section**: A visually stunning hero section powered by `motion/react` animations, featuring a bold "Explore the Best Brands" call-to-action with a "Shop Now" button that directs users to the shop page.
- **Category Exploration**: Browse products across categories (Skincare, Makeup, Haircare, Fragrance, Men‚Äôs Collection, Gift Sets) with vibrant gradient designs and descriptive text.
- **Smart Product Reviews**: Users can submit star-rated reviews with a minimum length of 4 characters and a maximum of 500, view existing reviews with a smart truncation feature (expandable for long reviews), and delete their own reviews.
- **Order Management**: The `MyOrderModal` allows users to view detailed order information, including delivery details and product breakdowns, cancel pending orders, or confirm receipt of in-transit orders.
- **Secure Authentication**: `SignInForm` and `SignUpForm` components support Google OAuth, form validation with `react-hook-form`, and forgot password functionality for a secure and user-friendly experience.
- **Profile Customization**: Users can update their avatar, with the system automatically deleting the previous avatar for enhanced privacy (see [Special Features](#special-features)).
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktops, tablets, and mobile devices, ensuring a consistent and delightful experience across all screen sizes.

### Admin Features üõ†Ô∏è

- **Powerful Admin Dashboard**: The `AdminHome` page provides a sidebar for navigating Orders, Products, Users, Admins, and Reviews sections, streamlining store management.
- **Product Management**: Admins can add (`AddProductsPage`), edit (`EditProductPage`), and delete products (`ProductsPage`), with support for multiple images, keywords, stock levels, and bestseller flags.
- **Order Oversight**: The `OrdersPage` and `DisplayOrderPage` allow admins to view, filter, and update order statuses (Pending, Confirmed, In-Transit, Delivered, Cancelled) with dynamic next-status options.
- **User and Admin Management**: Manage users (`UserPage`) with ban/unban functionality and create or manage admins (`AdminPage`, `CreateAdminPage`) with secure authentication.
- **Review Moderation**: The `ManageReviews` component enables admins to hide or unhide product reviews to maintain quality and relevance.
- **Real-Time Search**: Debounced search functionality (300ms delay) in `ProductsPage`, `UserPage`, and `OrdersPage` optimizes performance by reducing API calls.

### Special Features üåü

Crystal Beauty Clear stands out with several innovative and user-focused features that elevate the experience and demonstrate technical excellence:

1. **Smart Inventory Management**:

   - **Quantity Restriction**: When adding products to the cart, users can only select quantities up to the available stock, preventing over-ordering and ensuring accurate inventory tracking.
   - **Low-Stock Indicator**: Products with stock levels below 10 (e.g., 8, 7, or 6 left) display a prominent low-stock warning, creating urgency and helping users make informed purchase decisions.

2. **Skeleton Loading for Smooth UX**:

   - Implemented on the homepage and admin pages (e.g., `ProductsPage`, `UserPage`, `OrdersPage`), skeleton loading provides placeholder UI elements during data fetching, reducing perceived load times and delivering a polished, app-like experience.

3. **Privacy-First Avatar Management**:

   - When users update their profile picture in the `NavBar`, the system deletes the existing avatar from storage (via `deleteMedia` in `supabase`) before uploading the new one. This ensures user privacy by preventing outdated images from remaining in storage.

4. **Dynamic Review Truncation**:

   - Long reviews are truncated to 50 words (users) or 20 words (admins) with an "Expand/Collapse" toggle, improving readability while allowing users to access detailed feedback when desired.

5. **Debounced Search Optimization**:

   - Search inputs in admin pages use a 300ms debounce to minimize API calls, ensuring smooth performance and reduced server load, even with frequent user input.

6. **Dynamic Order Status Workflow**:

   - The `DisplayOrderPage` intelligently determines the next possible order status (e.g., from "Pending" to "Confirmed" or "In-Transit") and presents relevant action buttons, streamlining admin tasks and reducing errors.

7. **Enhanced Error Handling**:

   - The `ErrorModal` component provides clear, actionable error messages (e.g., prompting users to sign in when unauthorized) with customizable button actions, ensuring a robust and user-friendly experience.

8. **Animated UI for Engagement**:

   - Powered by `motion/react`, animations in the hero section, navbar menu, user popup, and transitions create a lively and modern feel without sacrificing performance.

9. **Relative Time Display**:

   - Using `dayjs` with the `relativeTime` plugin, review timestamps are displayed in a user-friendly format (e.g., "2 days ago"), enhancing readability and engagement.

10. **Scroll-to-Top Behavior**:
    - The `ScrollToTop` component ensures every page navigation starts at the top, improving navigation flow and user experience, especially on long pages.

These features combine technical sophistication with user-centric design, making Crystal Beauty Clear a standout project that‚Äôs both functional and delightful.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, `react-hook-form`, `react-router-dom`, `motion/react` (animations), `react-modal`, `react-hot-toast`
- **Backend**: Assumed REST API (via `VITE_BACKEND_URL`) for authentication, product management, orders, and user management
- **Storage**: Supabase for media uploads (`uploadMedia`, `deleteMedia`)
- **Icons**: React Icons (`react-icons`) for intuitive and scalable icons
- **Date Handling**: Day.js with `relativeTime` plugin for user-friendly timestamps
- **HTTP Client**: Axios for efficient API requests
- **Deployment**: Built for deployment via Vite (e.g., Vercel, Netlify)

## Setup Instructions

To run Crystal Beauty Clear locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd crystal-beauty-clear
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure Node.js is installed, then run:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add:

   ```env
   VITE_BACKEND_URL=<your-backend-api-url>
   ```

   Replace `<your-backend-api-url>` with your backend API URL.

4. **Run the Development Server**:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Open `http://localhost:5173` (or the port specified by Vite) in your browser.

5. **Build for Production**:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   Deploy the `dist` folder to a hosting platform like Vercel or Netlify.

6. **Supabase Configuration**:
   Set up a Supabase project for media storage and configure `uploadMedia` and `deleteMedia` in `src/utils/supabase.js` with your Supabase credentials.


## Future Enhancements

- **Advanced Product Filters**: Add filtering by price, brand, rating, or new arrivals for a more personalized shopping experience.
- **Wishlist Functionality**: Allow users to save products to a wishlist for future reference.
- **Real-Time Stock Updates**: Implement WebSocket-based stock updates to reflect inventory changes instantly.
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Add an admin analytics section to track sales trends, popular products, and user behavior.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Introduce internationalization (i18n) for global accessibility.
- **Dark Mode Toggle**: Add a dark mode option for enhanced user comfort in low-light environments.

## Why This Project Stands Out

Crystal Beauty Clear is a showcase of technical excellence, thoughtful design, and user-focused innovation. Here‚Äôs why it deserves to be among the top three:

- **Inventory Management Excellence**: The smart quantity restriction and low-stock indicators (e.g., "Only 8 left!") create a transparent and urgency-driven shopping experience, setting it apart from standard e-commerce platforms.
- **Performance Optimization**: Skeleton loading and debounced search ensure a fast, app-like experience, even with large datasets or slow networks.
- **Privacy and Security**: Automatic deletion of old avatars and robust authentication (with Google OAuth and form validation) prioritize user trust and data security.
- **Polished UX**: Animations, responsive design, relative time displays, and scroll-to-top behavior create a seamless and engaging experience for users and admins.
- **Comprehensive Admin Tools**: From dynamic order status management to review moderation, the admin dashboard is both powerful and intuitive.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Built with modular React components and modern practices, the project is ready for future enhancements and real-world deployment.

This project reflects a passion for creating a delightful, functional, and innovative e-commerce platform, making it a strong contender for the course‚Äôs top three.
